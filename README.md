# Hi, I'm Brandon ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student building optimized AI systems from scratch using **C++**, **CUDA**, and **Python**. I enjoy designing high-performance tools, exploring low-level system architecture, and solving complex problems with clean, efficient code.

## ðŸ”§ Skills
- **Languages:** C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Bash
- **AI/ML:** CUDA, FP16 optimization, GPU-accelerated matrix ops, softmax, transformers
- **Tools:** Git, Visual Studio, VSCode, GDB, CUDA Toolkit
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), performance benchmarking, test automation, low-level debugging
- **Other:** SQL, shell scripting, markdown, documentation writing

## ðŸ“‚ Projects
- **[Ada (AI Engine)](https://github.com/bran7230)** â€“ Custom transformer-based neural network built in C++ with CUDA, featuring FP16 math, Tensor Core acceleration, and full training/inference pipeline.
- **[Portfolio Site](https://github.com/bran7230)** â€“ Personal site to showcase projects (in development).
- More coming soon...

## ðŸ’¡ Interests
AI development, GPU programming, system optimization, low-level software architecture, and learning how things work under the hood.
